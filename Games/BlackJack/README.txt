Black Jack

What do I need?
Just download this folder and you are ready to go!

How do I start the game?
Sit down and run table.py

How do I play?
On your turn you can choose between drawing a card or passing.
If you pass you are unable to draw again in this round, the same applies to the dealer.

The rules to win are the same es the normal black jack:
- Have a higher score than the dealer
- Do not have a score above 21


Have fun!
